# Setup
We find the most relevant papers by scraping arxiv for the most recent and most cited papers that contain the users query string. We then pass all of the metadata on these papers (title, authors, url, etc) into the Claude API, and prompt Claude to tell us the most relevant paper to the user's query. We then take this relevant paper, and use Claude again to extract the key insights from the parsed text of this paper. Using some careful prompt engineering, we’ve managed to get Claude to also return references for each key insight it provides. These insights allow us to establish relationships between papers and concepts, and create that “knowledge/concept graph” that we create our user experience around. We can then recursively parse referenced papers from the first paper, create key insights (with sources) and continue building out the knowledge graph based on what concepts the user decides to look into. We then store this graph on a Firestore DB and display it as a set of nodes on the frontend using D3. Lastly, when the user wants to learn more about the concept/insight represented by a single one of those nodes, we query Claude again (with the parsed paper text and concept description as context) to give us an expanded, informative, and educational description of the concept. This is then rendered on the left hand side of the user's DOM.

Front-end built in React JS using D3, backend built in Python using FastAPI, arxiv (a third-party scraper), and the Anthropic Claude 2 API, both the server and the DB are hosted on firebase.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
